## Usage

Simple.

```js
copyjs("Text to copy", ?options);
```



## Options

All boolean values inside the `options` object.

`reSelect`: After copy, select (highlight) text that user was originally highlighting before copy. Default is `true`.

`html`: Copy HTML to clipboard instead of plain text; e.g. `copyjs('<h1 style="color:red;background-color:black;">Hello, world!</h1>', { html: true })`. Default is `false`.

**Result**:

![h1-example](h1-example.png)



`copyFromSelector`: Copy text from an HTML element with a selector. E.g.:

```html
<p id="p" style="color:red">
    Hello, world!
</p>
```

```js
copyjs("#p", { html: true, copyFromSelector: true });
```

**Result**:

![p-example](p-example.png)
